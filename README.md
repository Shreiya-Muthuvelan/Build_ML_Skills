## 📂 Current Structure

### Introduction to ML
Learn the foundations of Machine Learning and start building your first models.  

- `Basics of ML.ipynb` – Introduction to core ML concepts.  
- `Machine Learning Workflow.ipynb` – Overview of the end-to-end ML process.  
- `Core Concepts.ipynb` – Deep dive into algorithms, model evaluation, and metrics.  
- `Hands On- Your First ML Model.ipynb` – Build, train, and evaluate your first ML model.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Prepare your data for machine learning with cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.  

- **Datasets:** `data/` contains cleaned datasets for exercises (e.g., `adult_cleaned.csv`).  
- `1. Data cleaning.ipynb` – Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- `2. Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` – Data visualization and basic EDA.  
- `3. Data transformation.ipynb` – Scaling, encoding, and feature transformations.  
- `4. Feature engineering.ipynb` – Creating new features to improve model performance.

## Future Plans
- Add **Supervised Learning** notebooks: Regression & Classification.  
- Explore **Unsupervised Learning** and **Feature Selection**.  
- Build **end-to-end ML projects** with clean, reproducible pipelines.
