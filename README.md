# Build_ML_Skills

**Status:** Work in Progress 

This repository contains my hands-on journey learning Machine Learning. It is being updated gradually with notebooks, datasets, and notes as I progress through the topics.

## Current Structure

1. **Introduction to ML**
   - `Basics of ML.ipynb` : Introduction to core ML concepts.
   - `Machine Learning Workflow.ipynb` : 
   - `Core Concepts.ipynb` : 
   - `Hands On- Your First ML Model.ipynb` :

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - `data/` : Contains cleaned datasets used for exercises.
     - `adult_cleaned.csv`
   - `1. Data cleaning.ipynb` : Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   - `2. Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` : Basic EDA and visualization.
   - `3. Data transformation.ipynb` : Scaling, encoding, and feature transformations.
   - `4. Feature engineering.ipynb` : Creating new features to improve model performance.

## Future Plans
- Add **Supervised Learning** notebooks: Regression, Classification.
- Explore **Unsupervised Learning** and **Feature Selection**.
- Build **end-to-end ML projects** with clean pipelines.

## Notes
- The repo is being actively developed.
- Suggestions and contributions are welcome.
